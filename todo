- Add an endpoint that will return the data dump.
- Write a periodic cloud function that will call that and store it in a bucket.
- update deps for django
- setup CI on PRs / main that checks for formatting / lints
- setup typechecking in CI
- setup CI to deploy the site to wherever it runs right from main
- lookup how other sign language websites look, for inspo on the web ui
- convert advisory from a single thing to a list of advisories. use the HEAD request on the data in the bucket so clients can determine whether there is a new advisory (or something like that)
- reach out to gcp for free credits
- find the most compact way to distribute the data. probably just writing it as non-pretty json and then compressing it is pretty close to perfect.
- look into some serde kind of library for dart to aboid this whole json reading bonanza
- once the slsl app is there, refactor both dict apps to reduce code dupe. go for a better file structure, with api, components, pages, etc.
- get translations of all the help text.
- remember, we can't just internationalize the app and call it done, we expect users to want to be able to switch between languages easily, at least for definitions. but things like the help messages, the interface, etc. should be run through an i18n library.
    - the auslan app doesn't need it but it probably doesn't hurt to use the library anyway
- make all pages use the new buildTopLevelScaffold function
